Ateez is a band from Korea composed of 8 members:
* Hongjoong
* Seonghwa
* Yunho
* Yeosang
* San
* Mingi
* Wooyoung
* Jongho

They are extremely charismatic and are very much like a family.

The first of two you need to know of is Yeosang, who is on the the right side of the first picture and looks like this

One of his coolest moments is his vampire cape twirl about 6 seconds into [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IfwqfPqcyU&t=47s)

and one of his funniest

The second is Yunho, who is at the bottom of the first picture and looks like this

Two of his most iconic moments are
1. falling off the bed while trying to do a headstand in [this](https://www.vlive.tv/post/0-18376065) vlive at the 1 hour, 10 minute, 40 second mark.
